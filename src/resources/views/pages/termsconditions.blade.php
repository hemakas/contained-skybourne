          <p>If you do not check in for a confirmed flight booking you hold, this is considered as a &lsquo;&rsquo;no show&rsquo;&rsquo;. If you have any subsequent sectors such as a return sector or a multi city option, the airline will automatically cancel them in any event of a no show. If you do not intend to check in for any part of a confirmed flight you have booked, you must notify us immediately. Unfortunately, a &lsquo;&rsquo;no show&rsquo;&rsquo; could happen due to delays reporting at the airport caused by unexpected situations such as traffic delays, vehicle break down, sickness etc., therefore we advise you to travel to the airport having ample time. We hold no liability towards any loss, damage or fees imposed due to &lsquo;&rsquo;no shows&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

In the events of any changes done by the airlines to your confirmed itinerary (issued tickets only), once they notify us, we will contact you and inform you. If not, these changes will be notified to you at the time of check in at the airport. The airline may offer you alternative options as a result to schedule changes done by them. These include offering a full refund or giving alternative route or carrier without additional cost or offering a different flight on same carrier without additional cost or offer you some other solution. In any case, the final decision will be given by the respective airline. Amendments or alternatives chosen other than what the airline has offered may cost you additional charges.&nbsp;</p>
