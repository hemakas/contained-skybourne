            <h3>Escorted Tours</h3>
            <p>
              Let us take you on a journey. Our escorted tours are small group journeys with quality inclusions, like local tour leaders who can give you an authentic insight into the places they live and characterful accommodation in the best locations. We can hand-pick each part to include everything you need to get the most out of a destination and extra touches you may not expect, so that you’ll come away feeling that you got to know a destination in a unique way.

    Travelling with a group can give you the confidence to visit places you might not have considered independently and you’ll get to share new travel experiences with like-minded people. The small group tour holidays that we can arrange take you to see sights and arrange experiences that aren’t suitable for larger groups and we believe in a relaxed approach; there’s no need for seat rotations or headsets. All of our escorted small group tours are for over 16s.

                    <p>
                      Home of the great migration, the Big Five, mountain gorillas and far more, there’s nowhere better for a wildlife-watching holiday. In Swahili, the word ‘safari’ means ‘to go on a journey’ and an Africa safari offers a real adventure; the chance to travel deep into true wilderness and stray off the tourist trail.

  Travel by road, bumping along dusty tracks, taking in the vast, rolling landscapes and spotting wildlife along the way; or take to the skies for spectacular aerial views, flying in to tiny national park airstrips where lions roam the runway. No matter how many wildlife documentaries you’ve seen, nothing can prepare you for the real thing.

  Whether this is your first time treading the wilds of Africa, or you fell under its spell many visits ago, we can help you find your dream safari adventure.
